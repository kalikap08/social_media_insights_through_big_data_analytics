# social_media_insights_through_big_data_analytics

##Project Overview
The explosive growth of social media platforms has led to massive volumes of user-generated content, creating new opportunities for Big Data Analytics. This project applies machine learning and real-time data analytics to model large-scale social media interactions, uncovering trends related to user behavior, emotional well-being, and engagement patterns.

Using a Kaggle-based dataset, we built an XGBoost classifier achieving 98% accuracy in predicting user emotions across platforms such as Instagram, Twitter, and WhatsApp. Key findings include:

1.Instagram interactions are predominantly linked to happiness.

2.Twitter and WhatsApp show a higher presence of anger and sadness.

3.A moderate level of interaction (likes, posts, messages) correlates with positive emotional states, while over-engagement may lead to anxiety.

##Key Features
1.Big Data methodology for processing large-scale datasets.

2.Emotion prediction using the XGBoost algorithm.

3.Platform-specific trend analysis on user emotions and behaviors.

4.Correlation analysis between engagement metrics and emotional variance.

5.Real-time data processing and predictive modeling.
